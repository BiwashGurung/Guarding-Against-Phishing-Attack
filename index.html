    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>In today's digital age, we face a growing threat called phishing, where cyber tricksters use sneaky tactics to get hold of our personal information. This discussion aims to break down a recent phishing attack using tricky links and provide easy-to-follow tips for staying safe online, with insights from Cyber Security Expert Dexy Gurung.</p>

    <h2>Phishing Attack Basics:</h2>
    <p>Phishing is like a virtual fishing expedition where bad actors try to lure you into giving away sensitive informationâ€”like passwords or credit card details. Lately, they've been using fake links that, when clicked, take you to websites designed to steal your private data.</p>

    <h2>Spotting Sneaky Links:</h2>
    <p>Before clicking on any link, take a moment to hover your cursor over it. A little box will pop up showing the web address it leads to. Look out for misspelled words or weird variations of familiar website names. Also, check for "https" in the URL to ensure it's a secure site.</p>

    <h2>Keeping Safe:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Knowledge is Power:</strong> Learn about common phishing tactics. Being aware of the tricks they use can help you spot potential threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If an email or message seems fishy, it probably is. Double-check before clicking anything.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Add an extra layer of protection by enabling two-factor authentication. This means even if someone gets your password, they'll need another step to access your accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Your Security Software:</strong> Keep your antivirus and anti-malware software up to date. This helps your computer stay equipped to fight off the latest online threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Could Happen If You Click:</h2>
    <p>Clicking on a phishing link can have serious consequences. The bad guys might get into your accounts, mess with your personal info, or even install harmful software on your device. It's crucial to be cautious to avoid falling into these traps.</p>
